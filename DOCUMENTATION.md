## Overview

theSmallComparator is an advanced digital optical comparator that combines:
- High-resolution camera capture for visual inspection
- Precision CNC control via Arduino/GRBL interface
- Web-based interface accessible from any networked device
- DXF export for CAD integration
- Real-time coordinate measurement and recording



## Architecture

The system consists of multiple interconnected modules:

### Core Components
- **Flask GUI**: Web interface providing access from any device
- **Camera Manager**: Handles camera detection, initialization, and video streaming
- **Serial Communicator**: Manages communication with GRBL-based CNC controllers
- **Machine Controller**: Translates high-level commands to GRBL commands
- **DXF Handler**: Processes and exports measurement points to CAD format

### Web Interface
- Built with Flask for cross-platform web access
- Accessible at http://localhost:5001
- Real-time camera feed display
- CNC control with jog commands
- Position tracking and point recording
- DXF export functionality

## Installation Process

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- System packages for OpenCV and camera support

### Quick Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `install.sh`
3. Log out and back in (to apply group memberships)

### System-wide Installation
The installation script performs:
- System dependency installation (OpenCV, camera drivers, etc.)
- Python package installation via pip
- User group additions (video and dialout for camera/serial access)
- **On Fedora, it automatically attempts to configure SELinux to allow the application to run.**
- Optional systemd service for Raspberry Pi auto-start
- Validation of all required components

## System Configuration

### Auto-start Service
For systems using systemd (most Linux distributions including Raspberry Pi):

- **Enable auto-start**: `sudo systemctl enable theSmallComparator.service`
- **Disable auto-start**: `sudo systemctl disable theSmallComparator.service`
- **Start service**: `sudo systemctl start theSmallComparator.service`
- **Check status**: `systemctl is-active theSmallComparator.service`
- **View logs**: `sudo journalctl -u theSmallComparator -f`

### User Groups
The installation adds the user to important groups:
- **video**: For camera access (required for camera functionality)
- **dialout**: For serial communication (required for CNC/GRBL control)

## Hardware Integration

### Camera Support
- Automatic detection of connected cameras
- Multiple camera support with selection dropdown
- Real-time preview with crosshair target
- Optimized for USB webcams and industrial cameras
- Supports various resolutions and frame rates

### CNC Control (GRBL/Arduino)
- Direct serial communication with Arduino/GRBL
- Standard baud rates (115200) for compatibility
- Robust error handling with power state detection
- Jog controls with adjustable distances
- Home, unlock, and other machine functions

### Serial Communication
- Automatic detection of available COM ports
- Robust connection handling with retry logic
- Power state detection to differentiate communication errors from power issues
- Command queuing and response management

## Software Modules

## Command Extensions

### GRBL Parameter/Settings Access
Two new commands have been added to access GRBL configuration:

**$$ Command**: Lists all GRBL settings
- Access via raw command interface: `$$`
- Returns all configurable parameters with current values
- Useful for debugging and configuration verification

**$# Command**: Lists all GRBL parameters
- Access via raw command interface: `$#`
- Returns current work coordinate offsets, probing results, etc.
- Essential for verifying machine state

### Camera Refresh Functionality
New camera detection algorithm includes:
- `refresh_camera_detection()` function to detect newly connected cameras
- Web interface button to trigger refresh without app restart
- Multi-backend approach (V4L2, GStreamer, FFmpeg) for better compatibility
- Fast detection with timeout handling for unresponsive cameras

### Easy Launch Command
The `theSmallComparator` command provides:
- System-wide availability after installation
- Automatic installation directory detection
- Conflict prevention when already running
- Direct launch from any location

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Detected
1. Check if camera is physically connected: `ls -la /dev/video*`
2. Verify user is in video group: `groups $USER | grep video`
3. Add to video group: `sudo usermod -a -G video $USER`
4. Log out and log back in
5. Run the refresh camera function in the web interface

#### Serial Communication Issues
1. Verify Arduino/GRBL is connected and powered
2. Check if port is available: `ls -la /dev/tty{USB,ACM,S}*`
3. Confirm user is in dialout group: `groups $USER | grep dialout`
4. Add to dialout group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
5. Log out and log back in
6. Try different baud rates in the interface

#### Web Interface Not Accessible
1. Check if application is running: `ps aux | grep python`
2. Verify port 5001 is available: `netstat -tuln | grep 5001`
3. Check firewall settings if accessing remotely
4. Ensure Python dependencies are installed

#### SELinux Issues on Fedora
If you are on a Fedora system and the application is being blocked by SELinux, the installation script attempts to automatically create and install a local policy module to allow it to run. If you still encounter issues, you can try to generate the policy manually:

1.  Run the following commands to generate and install the policy:
    ```bash
    # ausearch -c '(python3)' --raw | audit2allow -M my-python3
    # semodule -X 300 -i my-python3.pp
    ```
2.  Reboot your system.

### System Service Issues
1. Check service status: `systemctl is-active theSmallComparator.service`
2. Check service logs: `sudo journalctl -u theSmallComparator.service -f`
3. Verify user permissions for hardware access
4. Check installation completed successfully
