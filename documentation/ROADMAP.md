# Comparatron Optimization Roadmap

## Project Goal
Optimize the Comparatron v1.1 software by splitting the monolithic main.py into modular components, fixing the camera selection issue, creating a proper dependency management system, and providing clear instructions for creating a Windows executable.

## Status Tracking
This roadmap will be updated in real-time as each optimization step is completed.
